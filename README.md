# CRUD LESSON
This lesson is taken from the [CRUD REST API] (https://www.atatus.com/blog/building-crud-rest-api-with-node-js-express-js-and-postgresql/) article.

This lesson requires the creation of a new database and a users table. As a best practice the lesson also shows how to create a new database user with access to the newly created database.  

The only change to this lesson was the addition of the dotenv package. It is necessary to create a .env file in order to use this application successfully. Review the queries.js file for the database connection parameters.
